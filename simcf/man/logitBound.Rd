\title{Logit transform a variable, creating dummy variables to record out of bound
cases}
\usage{
logitBound(x, base = exp(1), forceAny = FALSE, forceAll = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of data to be logit tranformed.  Need not be restricted to
the interval (0,1).}

\item{base}{The logarithmic base for transformation}

\item{forceAny}{Include a column of dummies for cases at or below the zero
bound whether or not such cases are present in x.}

\item{forceAll}{Include a column of dummies for cases at or above the unity
bound whether or not such cases are present in x.}
}
\value{
A matrix including up to three columns.  The last is always the
logit transformed x, with 0s for any case outside the (0,1) bound.  The
optional initial columns are 'any', which is 1 if the corresponding element
of x is greater than 0, and 'all', which is 1 if the corresponding element
of x is equal to or greater than 1.
}
\description{
If given a variable to logit transform which contains values less than or
equal to 0 or greater than or equal to 1, logitBound creates dummy variables
indicating the out of bound cases, and collects them in a matrix with the
logit transformed variable.
}
\details{
Computes the logit transformation, ln(x/(1-x).  Instead of reporting out of
bounds cases as -Inf or Inf, reports out of bounds cases as 0s, but includes
dummy variables indicating which boundary is breeched.  Including the output
of logitBound on the right-hand side of a regression model allows the user
to logit transform even variables which are exactly 0 or 1 by treating those
cases as sui generis exceptions.  Analogous to treating x as a hurdle
variable.

LogitBound transformed variables will work in the other functions in the
simcf package, but may fail when used in predict commands.
