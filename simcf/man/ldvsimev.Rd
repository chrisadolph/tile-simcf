\title{Simulate quantities of interest and confidence intervals for linear time
series models including ARIMA or lagged dependent variable processes}
\usage{
ldvsimev(x, b, ci = 0.95, constant = 1, phi = NULL, lagY = NULL,
  transform = "none", initialY = NULL, cumulate = FALSE, discount = 0,
  nscen = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector or matrix, counterfactual values of the covariates.  Include
multiple rows to simulate different counterfactual scenarios}

\item{b}{matrix, simulated parameters, one row per draw from the estimated
model, and one column per parameter, including any constants}

\item{ci}{vector, the requested intervals of the simulated quantity of
interest to be reported}

\item{constant}{scalar, the column of \code{b} containing the model
constant, or NA for no constant}

\item{phi}{scalar of point estimate, or matrix of simulated, AR or lagged DV
parameters}

\item{lagY}{scalar or vector, the prior levels of y or diff(y), most recent
first; must match number of columns of \code{phi}}

\item{transform}{string, transformation applied to the dependent variable in
the original model; \code{log}, for the natural log, \code{diff}, for
differencing; \code{difflog}, for differencing of a logged variable;
\code{logit} for the logistic transformation; \code{difflogit} for the
differencing of a logit transformed variable; and \code{none} for no
transformation (default)}

\item{initialY}{vector, for differenced models, the original level of the
response}

\item{cumulate}{logical, whether to additionally report cumulative values of
the quantity of interest (default is not to report).}

\item{discount}{scalar, the compounding discount rate to apply to future
periods in calculating cumulative quantities of interest; default is 0 for
no discounting.  Set as a proportion, so that 0.05 would be a 5 percent
discount rate.}

\item{xpre}{vector or matrix, counterfactual initial values of the
covariates.  Include multiple rows to simulate different counterfactual
scenarios; rows must match \code{x}; redundant and ignored if \code{x} is a
\code{counterfactual object}}

\item{rho}{scalar of point estimate, or matrix of simulated, MA parameters}

\item{lagY}{scalar or vector, the prior levels of the error term, most
recent first; must match number of columns of \code{rho}}

\item{sigma}{scalar of point estimate, or matrix of simulated, white noise
parameter or standard error of the regression}
}
\value{
Returns a list with at least four and as many as eight components:
\item{pe}{vector, the point estimate(s) of the requested quantity of
interest} \item{lower}{matrix, the requested lower bounds around the
quantity of interest; rows are scenarios, columns are intervals}
\item{upper}{matrix, the requested upper bounds around the quantity of
interest; rows are scenarios, columns are intervals} \item{se}{}
\item{pe.cumulative}{} \item{lower.cumulative}{} \item{upper.cumulative}{}
\item{se.cumulative}{}

\description{
Simulate and summarize uncertainty of iterated conditional expected values
(ev), expected first differences (fd), expected relative risks (rr),
predicted values (pv), predicted first differences (pd), and predicted
relative risks (pr) from estimated ARIMA or lagged dependent variable time
series linear models
}
\details{
Given simulated parameters from an estimated linear model with one or more
lagged dependent variables, and counterfactual values of the covariates,
these functions calculate either the conditional expected value of the
response iterated over several periods, or the conditional difference or
risk ratio over those periods, and confidence intervals around that point
estimate.  Alternatively, the last function calculates predicted values,
which include random noise and moving averages of that noise, also iterated
over time and with prediction intervals.  This function is thus suitable for
forming most desired quantities of interest from time series linear models
with ARIMA or lagged dependent variable processes.

If the function you used to estimate the model does not provide simulated
parameter values, you can draw often them yourself, e.g., using functions
such as \code{\link{vcov}} and \code{mvrnorm} in the \code{MASS} package, as
shown below.

zelig, in the package Zelig, offers similar features for a wide array of
models and with automated handling of the simulation process.  These
functions are offered as a simple alternative for users with simulations
already in hand.
