\title{Simulate quantities of interest and confidence intervals for loglinear
models}
\usage{
loglinsimev(x, b, ci = 0.95, constant = 1, period = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector, matrix, or list, counterfactual values of the covariates.
Include multiple rows to simulate different counterfactual scenarios.  If a
list, may contain \code{x} and \code{xpre} as dataframes, a formula object
to apply to them, and names for each scenario given as the row names for
component \code{x}}

\item{b}{matrix, simulated parameters, one row per draw from the estimated
model, and one column per parameter, including any constants}

\item{ci}{vector, the requested intervals of the simulated quantity of
interest to be reported}

\item{constant}{scalar, the column of \code{b} containing the model
constant, or NA for no constant}

\item{period}{scalar or vector, the length of the period over which the
count is simulated.}
}
\value{
Returns a list with four components \item{pe}{vector, the point
estimate(s) of the requested quantity of interest} \item{lower}{matrix, the
requested lower bounds around the quantity of interest; rows are scenarios,
columns are intervals} \item{upper}{matrix, the requested upper bounds
around the quantity of interest; rows are scenarios, columns are intervals}
\item{labels}{string vector, the names of each scenario (optional)}
}
\description{
Simulate and summarize uncertainty of conditional expected counts, first
differences and relative rates from estimated loglinear models, such as the
Poisson or Negative Binomial
}
\details{
Given simulated parameters from an estimated loglinear model, and
counterfactual values of the covariates, these functions calculate either
the conditional expected count (\code{loglinsimev}), the conditional first
difference (\code{loglinsimfd}), or the conditional relative rate of events
(\code{loglinsimrr}) and confidence intervals around these point estimate.

If the function you used to estimate the model does not provide simulated
parameter values, you can draw often them yourself, e.g., using functions
such as \code{\link{vcov}} and \code{mvrnorm} in the \code{MASS} package, as
shown below.

zelig, in the package Zelig, offers similar features for a wide array of
models and with automated handling of the simulation process.  These
functions are offered as a simple alternative for users with simulations
already in hand.
