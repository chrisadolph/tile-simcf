\title{Simulate quantities of interest and predictive intervals for heteroskedastic
linear models}
\usage{
hetnormsimpv(x, b, z, g, ci = 0.95, constant = 1, varconstant = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{list, a counterfactual object created by \code{cfMake}, or a vector
or matrix of counterfactual values of the covariates, including multiple
rows to simulate different counterfactual scenarios, and one column for each
covariate of the mean systematic component}

\item{b}{matrix, simulated parameters for the mean systematic component, one
row per draw from the estimated model, and one column per parameter,
including any constants}

\item{z}{list, a counterfactual object created by \code{cfMake}, or a vector
or matrix of counterfactual values of the covariates, including multiple
rows to simulate different counterfactual scenarios, and one column for each
covariate of the variance systematic component}

\item{g}{matrix, simulated parameters for the variance systematic component,
one row per draw from the estimated model, and one column per parameter,
including any constants}

\item{ci}{vector, the requested intervals of the simulated quantity of
interest to be reported}

\item{constant}{scalar, the column of \code{b} containing the constant for
the mean systematic component, or \code{NA} for no constant}

\item{varconstant}{scalar, the column of \code{b} containing the constant
for the variance systematic component, or \code{NA} for no constant}
}
\value{
Returns a list with components: \item{pe}{vector, the point
estimate(s) of the requested quantity of interest} \item{lower}{vector or
matrix, the requested lower confidence bounds around the quantity of
interest; rows are scenarios, columns are intervals} \item{upper}{vector or
matrix, the requested upper confidence bounds around the quantity of
interest; rows are scenarios, columns are intervals}
}
\description{
Simulate and summarize uncertainty of conditional predicted values from
estimated heteroskedastic linear models
}
\details{
In linear regression, the response variable is normally distributed with
variable mean but fixed variance across all observations.  In contrast, the
linear heteroskedastic model considers a normally distributed response
variable whose mean and variance both vary across observations:

\deqn{y_i \sim f_\mathrm{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma_i^2)}{y_i ~ Normal(mu_i,
sigma_i^2)}

The model contains a mean systematic component,

\deqn{\mu_i = x_ib}{mu_i = x_i * b}

and a variance systematic component,

\deqn{\sigma_i^2 = \mathrm{exp}(z_ig)}{sigma_i^2 = exp(z_i * g)}

The heteroskedastic normal model allows covariates to explain both changes
in the mean and changes in the variance of the response variable, and can be
estimated by maximum likelihood.

The functions documented above assume that the user has estimated such a
model, and wishes to calculate predicted values of the response for
hypothetical values of x and z.

\code{hetnormsimpv} takes simulated parameters b and g from an estimated
linear heteroskedastic model, and counterfactual values of the covariates
for the mean and variance systemtic components (x and z), and calculates the
conditional predicted value of the response, including uncertainty intervals
around that estimate.

You may use \code{cfMake} to initialize \code{counterfactual} objects for
\code{x} and \code{z}, or input them directly as matrices.

If the function you used to estimate the model does not provide simulated
parameter values, you can often draw them yourself, e.g., using functions
such as \code{\link{vcov}} and \code{\link{mvrnorm}} in the \pkg{MASS}
package, as shown below.

\code{\link[Zelig]{zelig}}, in the package \pkg{Zelig}, offers similar features for
a wide array of models and with automated handling of the simulation
process.  These functions are offered as a simple alternative for users with
simulations already in hand.
