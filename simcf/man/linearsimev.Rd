\title{Simulate quantities of interest and confidence intervals for linear models}
\usage{
linearsimev(x, b, ci = 0.95, constant = 1, sigma2 = NULL, sims = 10,
  save = FALSE, nscen = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{list, a counterfactual object created by \code{cfMake}, or a vector
or matrix of counterfactual values of the covariates, including multiple
rows to simulate different counterfactual scenarios, and one column for each
covariate}

\item{b}{matrix, simulated parameters, one row per draw from the estimated
model, and one column per parameter, including any constants}

\item{ci}{vector, the requested intervals of the simulated quantity of
interest to be reported}

\item{constant}{scalar, the column of \code{b} containing the model
constant, or \code{NA} for no constant}

\item{sigma2}{scalar or vector, either the estimated sigma2 from the linear
regression, or a vector of simulated sigma2's drawn from the model
posterior.  Only required if predicted values are desired.}

\item{sims}{scalar, the number of draws taken from the predictive
distribution of the response.  Only used if sigma2 is provided.  Default is
10 draws.}

\item{save}{logical, whether to save the simulated expected values (and
predicted values, if any), in addition to the point estimates and requested
intervals.  Default is FALSE.}

\item{xpre}{vector or matrix, counterfactual initial values of the
covariates.  Rows must match \code{x}.  Not needed when \code{x} is a
\code{counterfactual} object.}
}
\value{
Returns a list with at least three components, and as many as seven:
\item{pe}{vector, the point estimate(s) of the requested quantity of
interest} \item{lower}{vector or matrix, the requested lower confidence
bounds around the quantity of interest; rows are scenarios, columns are
intervals} \item{upper}{vector or matrix, the requested upper confidence
bounds around the quantity of interest; rows are scenarios, columns are
intervals} \item{plower}{vector or matrix, the requested lower predictive
bounds around the quantity of interest; rows are scenarios, columns are
intervals (requires sigma2 be an input)} \item{pupper}{vector or matrix, the
requested upper predictive bounds around the quantity of interest; rows are
scenarios, columns are intervals (requires sigma2 be an input)}
\item{ev}{vector or matrix, the simulated expected values; rows are
scenarios, columns are simulations (only given if save is TRUE)}
\item{pv}{vector or matrix, the simulated predicted values; rows are
scenarios, columns are simulations (only given if sigma2 is provided and
save is TRUE)}
}
\description{
Simulate and summarize uncertainty of conditional expected values, first
differences and relative risks from estimated linear regression models
}
\details{
Given simulated parameters from an estimated linear model, and
counterfactual values of the covariates, these functions calculate either
the conditional expected value of the response (\code{linearsimev}), the
conditional first difference (\code{linearsimfd}), or the relative risk
(\code{linearsimrr}), and confidence intervals around that point estimate
(optionally, predictive intervals as well, taking into account the
fundametal uncertainty in the response captured by sigma2).

Use \code{cfMake} to initialize a \code{counterfactual} object containing
\code{x} and \code{xpre}, or input them directly.

If the function you used to estimate the model does not provide simulated
parameter values, you can draw often them yourself, e.g., using functions
such as \code{\link{vcov}} and \code{\link{mvrnorm}} in the \pkg{MASS}
package, as shown below.

\code{\link{zelig}}, in the package \pkg{Zelig}, offers similar features for
a wide array of models and with automated handling of the simulation
process.  These functions are offered as a simple alternative for users with
simulations already in hand.
